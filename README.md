# Building Sentence-to-Word Encoder-Decoder for Image Paragraph Captioning

This repository includes a PyTorch implementation of [Building Sentence-to-Word Encoder-Decoder for Image Paragraph Captioning](). 

<!-- Our code is based on a simple implementation of  [A Hierarchical Approach for Generating Descriptive Image Paragraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06607). -->

### Requirements
* Python 3.6 (download coco-caption that support Python3 from [here](https://github.com/salaniz/pycocoevalcap))
* PyTorch 1.3.1 (with torchvision)
* tensorflow 2.0
