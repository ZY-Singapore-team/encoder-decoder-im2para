# Visual-Sentence Alignments for Image Paragraph Captioning

This repository includes a PyTorch implementation of [Visual-Sentence Alignments for Image Paragraph Captioning](). 

<!-- Our code is based on a simple implementation of  [A Hierarchical Approach for Generating Descriptive Image Paragraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06607). -->

### Requirements
* Python 3.6 (download coco-caption that support Python3 from [here](https://github.com/salaniz/pycocoevalcap))
* BERT-serving-server and client from [here](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service))
* Download and unzip pre-trained BERT model from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/cased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip)) and put the folder under ./data/
* PyTorch 1.3.1 (with torchvision)
* tensorflow 1.13.1 (bert-as-service doesn't support tensorflow 2.0)
